# sign-up-form-ToP
This is a project from The Odin Project named "Project: Sign-up Form"

I'll use this read me file as place to stored the Problem solving approach.

As the name suggest the main goal is to create a sign-up form. This way everything learned about forms could be put into practice.

Fist we created the different sections that the page will have. Is a good idea to created them in different div containers that way the manipulation of the elements will be easier. Note: all the content was created besides the form only a div for it whats defined.

Ones the content it's created is time for the style. That's where we applied all the CSS to make the GUI look good.

Finally, it's time to start working on the form adding the differet types depending on the requestes input along with labels and place holders to guide the user into entering that data. Also, some validations that will be linked to CSS styles to determine whether the input is the excpected or not a providing that feedback to the user with the change of colors for example.
